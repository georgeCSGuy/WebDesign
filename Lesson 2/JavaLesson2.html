				<h3 class = "subheading">2.1 Introduction:</h3>
				<p>
				In this lesson we will introduce you, the student to computation on a 
				computer.  Computers can calculate complex arithmetic problems at lightning 
				speed. This has proven to be supremely useful with the widespread use of 
				calculators. There are five basic arithmetic operations we will introduce in this
				lesson: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*) Division (/), and modulus 
				(%). Computers follow the same order of operations that we learned in our 
				elementary schooling, so it is important to remember:
				 <ul>
					<li>Parentheses </li>
					<li>Multiplication/Divison</li>
					<li>Addition/Subtraction</li>
				</ul>
				Notice how exponents are left out of the above. This is intentional because squaring, 
				cubing, or any other exponentiation is a more complicated topic for another lesson.
				As in Lesson 1, create a new Java Project, and lets call this one “Basic 
				Arithmetic”. Name the class “Basic_Arithmetic” and lets get started! If you need a 
				refresher, check Lesson 1 for how to set up a project and class.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subheading">2.2 Printing a Number:</h3>
				<p>
				In Hello World we printed a short phrase. Printing a number is almost 
				identical to printing a phrase, but without the quotes. 
				Try printing your favorite number.
				</p>
				<img src = "2.2Image.png">
				<br>
				<p>
				Above are two lines of code and their corresponding output. At first glance 
				these seem identical, however our computer treats them differently. The first line 
				treats “1” as a phrase, so we can’t perform mathematical operations on it. The 
				second line treats 1 as a number. When doing arithmetic, we always want to treat 
				numbers as, well, numbers!
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subheading">2.3 Adding, Subtracting and Multiplying:</h3>
				<p>
				Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are performed with the symbols +,-, 
				and * respectively. Try manipulating a few numbers with these operators.
				<img src = "2.3Image.png">
				<br>
				Above are four lines of code and their corresponding output. These are 
				simply calculations that you can do in your head or on a calculator to verify that the 
				computer was right. Notice how the fourth line of code performs the 2*3 portion 
				first, just like the order of operations.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subheading">2.4 Division:</h3>
				<p>
				The behavior of division is slightly more complicated than the other 
				operations. So far, we have dealt only with whole numbers, or “integers”. 
				Sometimes, the result of a division operation is a fraction. What does the computer 
				do in this situation?
				<br>
				<img src = "2.4Image1.png">
				<img src = "2.4Image2.png">
				<img src = "2.4Image3.png">
				<br>
				Above are five different cases of division. Although computers are very 
				powerful, only the first and third cases result in the correct answer. On the far right, 
				I included what the answers should have been. Notice how no matter what, the 
				computer rounds down, even for the last example when 2.66 is clearly closer to 
				three. This is called floor division and when working with whole numbers, Java 
				always does floor division. Of course, there is a simple fix to get around this issue, 
				but I will save that for the next lesson. Maybe you can figure out on your own. All it 
				takes is a adjusting how a number is formatted. 
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subheading">2.5 Modulus:</h3>
				<p>
				Modulus should be a term you are unfamiliar with, but fear not, it is 
				essentially a synonym for remainder. When performing division we often encounter 
				cases of imperfect division. That is, when we can’t make equal groups. Imagine we 
				live in a world that has yet to develop the knife. I have five apples, and want to share 
				them with you. I prepare two baskets, and place an apple in each until suddenly, I 
				only have one apple but I can’t put it in either basket because that’s unfair. The 
				modulus operator gives this apple. In the previous section we printed (5/2) and got 
				2. If we did 5%2, we would get 1, the leftover apple that has no home.

				<h3 class = "subheading">2.6 Closing:</h3>
				<p>
				As in the real world, arithmetic is fairly simple once you know the 
				basics. In our next lesson we will look at variables, which we can use in 
				conjunction with our basic arithmetic.
